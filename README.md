We created a cute and simple game inspired by the newlyweds game to check how well friends know each other. 

## How it works

The game asks the two players for their topic of interest. Then 3 questions are chosen randomly from a database of questions. For each question, the guesser choses the answer, that they think the other person would've picked. They do so by pushing the buttons on the remote (made using an Arduino). The other player answers on his own remote. If a green tick appears, their answers are matching, so the guesser selected the correct answer. If the guesser chose the wrong answer, the screen shows a red cross on the guessed choice and an arrow on the correct answer. To move on to the next question, press the space bar. After 3 questions, the final score is displayed.
