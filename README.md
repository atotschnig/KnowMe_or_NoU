# KnowMe_or_NoU
BostonHacks 2019 project
We created a cute and simple game inspired by the newlyweds game to check how well friends know each other.
CONTRIBUTORS: Agnes Totschnig, Saumyaa Verma, Sarah Santoso, Aria Rens, Julia Fowler
HOW IT WORKS: The game asks the user for their topic of interest. After this it choses 3 questions from a database of questions.
              The guesser then choses the answer they think the other person would've picked for each question. 
              They do this by pushing the buttons on the remote (made using an arduino).
              If they see a tick this means the guesser selected the correct answer. 
              If the guesser choses the wrong answer, they see a cross on the guessed choice and an arrow on the chosen one.
              To move on to the next question, press the space bar.
              After 3 questions, it displays the score.
